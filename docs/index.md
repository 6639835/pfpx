## What is PFPX Navdata?

PFPX (Professional Flight Planner X) uses specialized navigation database files in a proprietary binary format. These files contain essential aviation data including airports, runways, navigation aids, airways, and flight procedures.

Our documentation provides complete analysis and tools for working with these files.

## Key Benefits

✅ **Understand the format** - Detailed breakdown of file structure and encoding  
✅ **Automate processing** - Python tools for fast encoding/decoding  
✅ **Extract data** - Access runway, waypoint, and airway information  
✅ **Integrate systems** - Connect PFPX data with other aviation tools  
✅ **Research & analyze** - Study navigation database content and structure  

## Quick Start

1. **[Learn the basics](./guide/getting-started.md)** - Understanding navdata files
2. **[Set up tools](./tools/python-decoder.md)** - Install the Python decoder  
3. **[Try examples](./tools/examples.md)** - Practical usage scenarios
